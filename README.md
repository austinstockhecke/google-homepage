Hello! Welcome to my first personal project. I haven't done much development outside of school, which I blame on working a full time job inbetween.

This project is very simple and for me was mostly a refresher. I build a non-functional Google homepage. The search bar doesn't work and none of the links work, but that's not the point of this project.
